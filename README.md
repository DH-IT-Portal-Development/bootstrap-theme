# Portaldev Bootstrap theme

A theme/extension of/on Bootstrap 5 for nice websites conforming to the UU brand.

## Usage

Either include ``scss/bootstrap.scss`` in your SCSS or use one of the compiled CSS files in `dist`.

This package contains all the Bootstrap 5 CSS, but you'll need to source your own copy of the Bootstrap 5 JavaScript.

For detailed implementation details, see the docs!

## Docs

See the documentation on [GH Pages](https://dh-it-portal-development.github.io/bootstrap-theme/).

The ``docs/`` folder contains the source that also can act as a development environment. See the
readme in that folder on how to set things up.
